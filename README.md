# JavaScript_Projects
 The repository for all my JavaScript projects I'll create during the Tech Academy bootcamp.
 
 This repository includes several of my practice exercise, including some projects:
 
 1. TicTacToe Project
 
 This project is a basic representation of TicTacToe. Players manually select their spots, whereas the opponent's placement is randomly selected. JS is used for checking win conditions and executing win conditions.
 
 2. Pizza Project
 
 A simple website to emulate a pizza parlor's online ordering site. JS is used to find the type of pizza ordered and the different toppings, returning the total price of the pizza.
 
 3. Calculator Project
 
 A website that emulates a simple calculator. Utilizes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
